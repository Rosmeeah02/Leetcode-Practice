""" 
Time Complexity: O(n)

-> Where n = length of the strings (s and t)
-> len(s) and len(t) â†’ O(1)
-> First for loop over s â†’ O(n)
-> Second for loop over t â†’ O(n)
-> Comparing two dictionaries â†’ O(k), where k is the number of unique characters (bounded by 26 lowercase letters â†’ so treated as O(1))
-> So total time: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1) (technically O(k), but k â‰¤ 26)

-> count_s and count_t store character counts
-> Worst case: each has up to 26 keys (aâ€“z)
-> So extra space = 2 dictionaries of max 26 keys â†’ treated as O(1)
-> So total space: O(1)

ðŸ”¹ Summary for Notes:
Time: O(n) â†’ loops through both strings
Space: O(1) â†’ at most 26 keys in each dict (constant alphabet size)
Let me know if you're planning to solve the Unicode version (non-lowercase-only) â€” that changes things a bit!
